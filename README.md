# Forecast-Dashboard<br>
<br>
🌤 Weather Forecast Dashboard using Power BI<br>
Here’s a quick look at my latest project — a real-time Weather Forecast Dashboard built in Power BI, integrating live API data to present.<br>
This project was a fantastic opportunity to dive into real-time data analysis and create a visually appealing, insightful report that goes beyond a basic forecast.<br>
<br>
📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): I've created several KPIs to track and visualize critical weather metrics:<br>
Wind Speed: 🌬️<br>
Pressure: 💨<br>
Humidity: 💧<br>
Visibility: 🔎<br>
UV Index: ☀️<br>
Precipitation: 🌧️<br>
<br>
🎨 Interactive Visuals: The report is brought to life with custom visuals that tell a compelling story:<br>
Forecast Weather Visual: A clear, intuitive display of upcoming conditions. 🌤️<br>
Sunrise & Sunset Visual: Track daylight hours and plan your day accordingly. 🌅<br>
Chance of Rain Visual: Understand the probability of precipitation. ☔<br>
Air Quality Index (AQI) Visual: Monitor local air quality for health and safety. 😷<br>
<br>
This project demonstrates my skills in data extraction, transformation, and visualization, turning raw data into a valuable, easy-to-use tool. It's a great example of how Power BI can be used to analyze and present complex, real-world data in a meaningful way.<br>
I'm keen to hear your thoughts on this project and discuss how data can be used to solve everyday problems!<br>
